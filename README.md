# NutriGuard AI 🧠❄️

NutriGuard AI is an AI-powered health intelligence platform built on Snowflake to enable early detection of malnutrition and health risks among children and pregnant women in rural communities.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Malnutrition is often detected too late due to fragmented data, manual monitoring, and lack of predictive insights. This leads to preventable health complications.

## 💡 Solution
NutriGuard AI uses Snowflake Data Cloud, Snowpark, and Cortex AI to analyze health and nutrition data and generate early risk predictions, enabling timely intervention.
