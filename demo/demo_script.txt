NutriGuard AI – Demo Script
AI for Good Hackathon | Snowflake

----------------------------------------
1. Introduction (0:00 – 0:20)
----------------------------------------
Hello, my name is Jay Vekariya.
Today, I’m presenting NutriGuard AI — an AI-powered platform built on Snowflake to enable early detection of malnutrition and health risks among children and pregnant women.

----------------------------------------
2. Problem Statement (0:20 – 0:45)
----------------------------------------
Malnutrition is often detected too late due to fragmented data, manual monitoring, and lack of predictive insights.
As a result, preventable health complications continue to impact vulnerable communities.

----------------------------------------
3. Solution Overview (0:45 – 1:15)
----------------------------------------
NutriGuard AI centralizes health and nutrition data on Snowflake and uses AI-powered analytics to identify high-risk individuals early.
This enables NGOs and health authorities to take timely, targeted action.

----------------------------------------
4. Architecture & Snowflake Usage (1:15 – 1:45)
----------------------------------------
Data from Anganwadi centers and surveys is securely ingested into Snowflake Data Cloud.
Using Snowpark and Snowflake Cortex, the system analyzes growth and nutrition patterns and generates risk scores.
These insights are made available through interactive dashboards.

----------------------------------------
5. Live Prototype Walkthrough (1:45 – 2:30)
----------------------------------------
This dashboard shows:
- Total children and pregnant women monitored
- High-risk cases requiring immediate attention
- Risk distribution across regions

Authorities can quickly identify where intervention is most needed.

----------------------------------------
6. Impact & Value (2:30 – 2:50)
----------------------------------------
By enabling early detection, NutriGuard AI can reduce preventable health risks, optimize resource allocation, and improve public health outcomes at scale.

----------------------------------------
7. Closing (2:50 – 3:00)
----------------------------------------
NutriGuard AI demonstrates how AI and data on Snowflake can be a powerful force for social good.
Thank you.
